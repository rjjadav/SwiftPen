  <h1>About SwiftPen</h1>

  <p>Swiftpen is digital information cum intelligence platform dedicated to the needs of the reader curious about business knowledge. Anything and everything related to business, literally. Be it business news, business models, business plans, business risks or even businessmen.</p>
  <p>Swiftpen is founded by an IIT-IIM duo, who believes that even though we are professionals by training and investors by breed, we are fundamentally investigators at heart.</p>
  <p>We are not trying to be just another business and deal news website or a tech related portal or even another investment recommendation engine. We are storytellers.</p>
  <p>Our aim is to discover, investigate and deliver crisp and creative snippets of the business world, which create an instinctive ‘wow’ moment for the reader. Pure objective research with a twist. Every day, every time.</p>
  <p>As we continuously strengthen our research capabilities, we will look to expand the breadth and depth of our focus.</p>
  <p>We would love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:info@swiftpen.com">info@swiftpen.com</a></p>
